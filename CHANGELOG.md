# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Usage Bar are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Skills used today now tracks last-used time per skill, not just a count
  — the list sorts most-recently-used first instead of by count, so it
  answers "what did I just use" as well as "which skills, how often."
  `--dump` prints the same ordering.

### Changed

- Limit style (bar/ring/percent) moved to the menu bar — it was originally
  wired to the popover's rows in 0.7.0, but that was the wrong surface; the
  popover always shows the full bar meter now, same as before 0.7.0. The
  menu bar's compact title draws a small inline bar or ring graphic instead
  of (or alongside) the percentage, per the Settings › General picker.

### Added

- Budget alert (Settings › Cost) — set a $/day or $/30-days cap; the menu
  bar shows a warning segment and the popover's Analytics pane shows a
  banner once spend crosses 80% of it.
- Native notifications when a limit window drops below the warn threshold
  or the budget alert goes over (Settings › General toggle) — fires once
  per crossing, not repeatedly.
- "Copy Usage Report" button in the popover footer — copies a plain-text
  summary of today's stats to the clipboard.
- Calendar heatmap in the Analytics pane (Settings-free, always on) — a
  GitHub-contributions-style grid over the last 30 days, reusing the same
  trend data already fetched for the trend chart.

### Fixed

- Hourly chart's per-provider legend and both charts' axis labels were
  rendering garbled/missing. Cause: a detached `NSTextField` had `.frame`
  set but was never added as a subview, so nothing established a
  coordinate offset for it — calling `.draw(text.bounds)` on it directly
  ignored `frame.origin` entirely and drew every label piled up at the
  parent view's origin instead of its intended position. Replaced with
  direct `NSString.draw(in:withAttributes:)`, which honors the given rect
  correctly (same technique the "No usage recorded" placeholder already
  used, just not consistently).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Customizable limit display style — Settings › General now has a Bar /
  Ring / Percent-only picker for how each limit window is drawn. Ring is a
  new circular arc meter; Percent-only drops the meter graphic entirely for
  a denser, text-only row.
- Analytics pane split into "Today" and "Trend" sections:
  - Today's hourly chart now draws three separate colored lines
    (Claude/Codex/Antigravity) with a legend instead of one blended line —
    tokens and prompt-counts aren't the same unit, so summing them into one
    number was never that meaningful.
  - New 7-day / 30-day trend chart (stacked daily cost bars per provider,
    with a segmented range switcher) — Analytics previously only knew
    about today.
  - Busiest weekday note in the 30-day view.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Per-provider "show in menu bar" toggle in Settings › Providers (the eye
  icon on each row) — independent of drag order, and independent of the
  popover, so a provider can stay reachable via the popover's sidebar while
  being hidden from the compact status-bar title.
- Changelog tab in Settings, reading this file bundled into the app.

### Fixed

- Popover was sizing itself to the full (unclipped) height of its ScrollView
  content instead of the intended fixed 480pt — NSHostingController's
  automatic content-size tracking doesn't play well with a ScrollView inside
  a fixed frame. Popover size is now pinned explicitly.
- Footer buttons (Refresh Now, Check for Updates, Settings, Quit) were
  `.borderless` — flat text with no visible button chrome. Now `.bordered`.
- `make-app.sh` had a hardcoded local-build version fallback (`0.4.0`) that
  never got updated across several later releases, so any ad-hoc local
  build reported a stale version regardless of what was actually built.
  It now defaults to the latest git tag instead.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Dropdown redesigned from a single scrolling NSMenu into a popover with a
  side tab bar — Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity / Analytics, one click
  switches panes instead of scrolling past everything. A persistent footer
  (refresh countdown, Refresh Now, Check for Updates, Settings, Quit) stays
  visible regardless of which tab is selected. Refresh Now no longer closes
  the window — data updates live in place.
- All existing rows (limits, today's tokens, cache hit rate, per-model
  breakdown, skills used, avg/session, 7-day/30-day cost, hourly chart)
  carried over 1:1 into the new panes, still gated by the same Settings
  toggles.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- "Skills used today" — tallies Claude Code `Skill` tool invocations
  (e.g. `/commit`, `/graphify`) from today's transcripts, shown in the
  Claude Code dropdown section and toggleable in Settings › General.
  Reuses the existing token-usage dedup logic so re-streamed log entries
  don't double-count.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Custom app icon (`Resources/AppIcon.icns`) — purple gradient squircle with
  a usage-meter capsule and a sparkle accent. Previously the app had no icon
  at all and fell back to the generic system placeholder.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Add a daily Analytics section with an hourly line chart and peak activity
  hour.
- Show Antigravity quota remaining for the 5-hour and weekly windows when
  quota data is available.
- Animate the Antigravity logo in the menu bar while an AI task is running.
- Fall back to Antigravity prompt counts when quota data is unavailable.
- Reorderable provider order: drag Claude/Codex/Antigravity into any order in
  Settings › Providers — the same order now drives both the status-bar
  segments and the dropdown sections.
- More dropdown data: per-model cost/token breakdown (Claude), cache hit
  rate, average cost/tokens per session, and 7-day/30-day cumulative cost per
  provider.
- Live USD→THB exchange rate, auto-fetched periodically from
  api.frankfurter.app (Settings › Cost), with a manual override and a
  Refresh Now button.
- Settings window redesigned as four top tabs (General / Providers / Cost /
  Log) instead of one long scrolling form; the log viewer now has its own
  page.

### Fixed

- Antigravity 5-hour/weekly rows no longer silently disappear right around a
  window's rollover — they now show a "window reset" note like Claude/Codex
  instead of vanishing even though today's usage exists.
- Claude limit rows no longer show a blank gap before the first fetch
  resolves; a "Fetching limits…" note shows instead.
- The 5-hour/Weekly toggle in Settings now actually hides/shows the
  corresponding row in the dropdown, not just the menu-bar title.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Antigravity local prompt usage tracking and cost analytics:
  - Detects Antigravity CLI history files under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`.
  - Tracks today's prompts and session counts.
  - Computes estimated cost using Gemini 3.5 Flash list prices (assuming 1.5K input / 800 output tokens per prompt).
  - Displays Gemini brand icon/color in the status bar and dropdown.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Point the Sparkle update feed and repository links at the renamed repo
  (`AI_Usage` → `ai-usage-bar`); the old appcast URL now 404s, so builds
  carrying it cannot auto-update. **v0.3.0 shipped with the dead feed URL —
  install this version instead.**
- Recheck an expired login every minute (instead of every 5) so the display
  recovers almost as soon as the Claude CLI writes a fresh token.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Show estimated cost of today's tokens per provider, priced at API list
  prices per model and shown in both THB and USD (exchange rate configurable
  in Settings).
- Diagnostics log (API calls, keychain reads, errors) with a viewer in
  Settings; stored at `~/Library/Logs/AIUsageBar/`.
- Live countdown ring in the dropdown showing seconds until the next refresh.
- Show the app version in the dropdown menu.
- Settings toggles for which Claude windows (5-hour / weekly) drive the
  menu-bar percentage.
- Surface usage-API failures in the dropdown with the cause (HTTP status /
  error) and the age of the cached data still on display.
- Persist the last good Claude limits across relaunches, so the dropdown shows
  cached data (with its age) instead of nothing while the first fetch runs or
  is rate limited.

### Changed

- Wider dropdown (300 → 380) with token stats paired two per row, roughly
  halving the menu height.
- Wider Settings window with the menu-bar options grouped on one row.
- Honor the usage API's `Retry-After` on 429: nothing refetches before the
  server-given time — not the timer, not ⌘R, not a relaunch (the penalty
  window persists to disk) — and the dropdown shows a retry countdown.

### Fixed

- Parse fractional-second `resets_at` timestamps so Claude "resets in" no
  longer shows "—".
- Cache the Claude access token in memory: the keychain is read once per
  launch (and again only after a 401) instead of on every limits poll,
  cutting password prompts dramatically.
- Never start a second limits fetch while one is blocked on the keychain
  dialog — previously each 60s tick stacked another password prompt.
- Periodic refresh keeps firing while the dropdown is open (timer moved to
  `.common` run-loop mode).
- `make-app.sh` accepts `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` (and auto-detects a local
  "AIUsageBar Signing" certificate) so builds signed with a stable identity
  keep the keychain "Always Allow" grant across updates.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Fix the bundled Sparkle framework path so the released app launches normally.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Add Sparkle automatic updates using signed releases and a GitHub Pages appcast.
- Add **Check for Updates…** to the menu-bar menu.

### Known issue

- This release cannot launch because the bundled Sparkle framework path is
  missing. Install v0.2.1 instead.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- First preview release of AI Usage Bar.
- Show Claude Code and Codex token usage and rate-limit readings in the macOS
  menu bar.
